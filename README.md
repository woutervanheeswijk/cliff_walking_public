# Cliff Walking
This project demonstrates a number of common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, applied on Sutton & Barto's cliff walking problem. The aim is to aid understanding of RL mechanisms in a comprehensive environment. For this purpose, the code is relatively integrated and hard-coded. I intermittedly add new algorithms and refactor the code.

The project currently contains the following algorithms:
- Q-learning 
- SARSA
- Deep Q-learning
- Discrete policy gradient
- Deep policy gradient

Neural network approaches are incorporated using TensorFlow.

My series of blog posts provides descriptions and interpretations of the implemented algorithms and their resuls:
